# To set up swell tracker just make a dev_config.js file in the root directory
# Sign up for an account with stormglass.io and positionStack
# Then all you need to do is add your api keys into the module.ecports in the config file as stormglass and positionStack;
# Now you are good to go and start tracking some swells!
